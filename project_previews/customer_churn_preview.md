This project tackles the critical business challenge of customer churn by analyzing historical data from a telecommunications provider. It involves comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), strategic feature engineering, and the development of machine learning models to accurately predict at-risk customers. The primary goal is to uncover key churn drivers and deliver actionable insights for proactive customer retention strategies, ultimately aiming to reduce customer attrition and enhance loyalty.

### Key Highlights:
* **Predictive Churn Modeling:** Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning classification models (including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to accurately identify customers with a high propensity to churn.
* **In-depth Data Exploration & Feature Engineering:** Conducted extensive EDA to uncover underlying patterns in customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior, creating impactful features to enhance model performance.
* **Actionable Retention Strategies:** Translated model interpretations and data insights into specific, data-driven recommendations for targeted retention campaigns and customer satisfaction initiatives.
* **Comparative Model Performance Analysis:** Systematically compared various algorithms based on key evaluation metrics to determine the most effective and reliable model for churn prediction.
