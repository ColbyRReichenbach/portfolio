This project tackles the critical business challenge of customer churn. By analyzing historical customer data from a telecommunications provider, it aims to identify key factors that lead to customers discontinuing service and develop a predictive model to flag at-risk individuals. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for proactive customer retention strategies.

The analysis involves comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering to create meaningful predictors, and the development and evaluation of several machine learning classification models.

**Key Highlights:**

* In-depth EDA to understand customer demographics, service usage, and churn patterns.
* Application of various feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
* Built and compared multiple predictive models (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to identify the most effective churn predictor.
* Derived actionable insights from model interpretations to suggest targeted retention campaigns and improve customer satisfaction.

**Technologies & Skills:**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Machine Learning (Classification, Model Evaluation)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering
* Data Visualization
* Business Acumen & Strategy
