This project delivers an internal analytics dashboard for an e-commerce business, leveraging Python and Streamlit to transform 2.5 years of sales, customer, and product data into actionable intelligence. The system provides stakeholders with real-time, intuitive visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. It enables dynamic exploration of business performance through filters for date ranges and customer geography, directly supporting data-driven decision-making for marketing, sales, and inventory management.

### Key Highlights:

* **Interactive Data Exploration:** Features a user-friendly Streamlit interface with dynamic filters, allowing users to drill down into specific time periods and geographic regions for granular insights.
* **Actionable Business Intelligence:** Designed to help identify growth opportunities, understand customer preferences, pinpoint operational bottlenecks (e.g., in shipping), and optimize marketing spend.
* **Centralized Performance Monitoring:** Provides a single source of truth for various departments to monitor overall e-commerce health and make informed strategic adjustments.
