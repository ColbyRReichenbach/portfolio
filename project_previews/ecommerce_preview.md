This project demonstrates the creation of an internal analytics dashboard for an e-commerce business, built using Python and Streamlit. The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders with real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The goal is to empower data-driven decision-making across various departments, including marketing, sales, and inventory management.

**Key Features:**

* Interactive visualizations of crucial e-commerce metrics (e.g., revenue, orders, average order value, customer lifetime value, top-selling products).
* User-friendly interface with filters for date ranges, product categories, customer segments, and other relevant dimensions.
* Developed using Python, with Streamlit for the web application framework, Pandas for data manipulation, and libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib/Seaborn for dynamic charting.
* Aids in identifying growth opportunities, understanding customer preferences, and optimizing marketing spend.

**Technologies & Skills:**

* Python, Streamlit
* Pandas, NumPy
* Data Visualization (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Dashboard Design & Development
* Business Intelligence, E-commerce KPIs
