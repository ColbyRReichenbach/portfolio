This project showcases an advanced marketing system using an **Epsilon-Greedy Multi-Armed Bandit** to maximize campaign **profit**. Unlike traditional A/B tests that might focus solely on clicks, this system dynamically allocates budget to ad creatives that demonstrate the highest profitability in real-time, factoring in costs and conversion values.

The core of the project is an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** where users can configure and run simulations. This allows for a robust comparison against A/B testing, clearly demonstrating the financial benefits of an adaptive, profit-driven approach.

### **Key Highlights:**

* **Profit-Focused Optimization:** Employs a reinforcement learning (Epsilon-Greedy Bandit) strategy to directly maximize financial return, not just engagement metrics.
* **Interactive Simulation Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit, allowing users to configure parameters (like fixed vs. decaying epsilon) and visualize comparative performance.
* **Statistical Evaluation:** Compares the bandit's profit generation against a traditional A/B test across multiple simulation runs, displaying average outcomes and performance consistency with standard deviation bands.
* **Demonstrates Superior ROI:** (User to update this point with results) Consistently shows significant profit uplift over A/B testing.

### **Core Technologies & Concepts:**

* Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandits, Epsilon-Greedy)
* A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
* ROI Optimization & Marketing Analytics
