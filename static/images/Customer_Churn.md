## **1. Executive Summary**  
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses, leading to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.  
This analysis examines **customer churn patterns**, develops **predictive models**, and proposes **actionable recommendations**  
to enhance customer retention.  

### **Key Findings:**  
âœ” Customers on **month-to-month contracts** churn at significantly higher rates.  
âœ” **Senior citizens** and those with **high monthly charges** are more likely to churn.  
âœ” Customers using **Electronic Check** payment methods exhibit the highest churn rates.  
âœ” The **predictive model achieves 84% accuracy**, making it suitable for **automated churn flagging**.  

### **Actionable Recommendations:**  
âœ” Improve **onboarding & early customer engagement** to reduce early churn.  
âœ” Offer **discounts or incentives for long-term contracts**.  
âœ” Implement **proactive outreach for high-risk customers** flagged by the AI model.

## **2. Introduction**  
Customer churn is the percentage of customers who discontinue using a service within a given period.  
High churn can lead to **revenue loss** and **customer acquisition cost increases**.  

This analysis aims to:  
- Understand **why customers churn**  
- Identify **key risk factors**  
- Develop **predictive models** to prevent churn  
- Recommend **data-driven strategies** for retention  

---

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings**  

### **3.1 Churn Distribution**  
Understanding the **overall churn rate** helps establish the scale of the issue.  

![Churn Distribution](./Visuals/churn_distribution.png) 

- The dataset reveals a **churn rate of approximately 26.5%**.  
- A quarter of the customer base is leaving, highlighting a need for **targeted retention efforts**.  

---

### **3.2 Contract Type & Payment Method Impact on Churn**  
One of the strongest predictors of churn is **contract type**.  

![Contract & Payment vs Churn](./Visuals/contract_payment_method_vs_churn.png)  

âœ” Customers on **month-to-month contracts churn the most**, indicating a lack of commitment to long-term service.  
âœ” **One-year and two-year contract customers churn significantly less**, suggesting that **contract incentives** may help.  
âœ” Customers paying via **Electronic Check** are more likely to churn, possibly due to dissatisfaction or manual payment inconvenience.  

---

### **3.3 Customer Demographics & Churn**  
Demographic factors, such as **age, gender, and dependents**, play a role in churn behavior.  

![Customer Demographics vs Churn](./Visuals/customer_demographics_vs_churn.png)  

âœ” **Senior Citizens** exhibit **higher churn rates**, possibly due to technology barriers or cost concerns.  
âœ” Customers without **dependents** or **partners** are more likely to churn, indicating a lower barrier to exit.  

---

### **3.4 Service Usage & Churn**  
Different service types impact customer retention.  

![Service Usage vs Churn](./Visuals/service_usage_vs_churn.png)  

âœ” Customers with **Fiber Optic Internet churn at higher rates**, possibly due to service quality or pricing.  
âœ” Customers **without Tech Support or Online Security services churn more**, suggesting that value-added services improve retention.  

---

### **3.5 Tenure & Monthly Charges Impact on Churn**  
Customer **tenure (time with the company) and billing amounts** significantly affect churn likelihood.  

![Tenure & Monthly Charges vs Churn](./Visuals/tenure_monthly_charges_vs_churn.png)  

âœ” **Short-tenured customers (0-12 months) churn at the highest rates**, emphasizing the importance of **early engagement strategies**.  
âœ” **Higher monthly charges correlate with higher churn**, indicating that pricing sensitivity plays a role in customer retention.  

---

## **4. Predictive Modeling & Evaluation**  

To predict customer churn, we trained **three machine learning models**:  

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    | **84%**  |
| Decision Tree         | 83%       |
| Random Forest         | 83%       |

### **4.1 Feature Importance Analysis**  
Which factors contribute most to churn?  

![Feature Importance](./Visuals/Feature_Importance.png)  

âœ” **Total Charges, Monthly Charges, and Tenure** are the **most significant predictors** of churn.  
âœ” **Contract type and payment method** also strongly impact churn rates.  

---

### **4.2 Model Performance Evaluation (ROC Curve)**  
How well do our models differentiate churners from non-churners?  

![ROC Curve](./Visuals/ROC_Curve.png)  

âœ” **All models perform well, with the Logistic Regression model achieving 84% accuracy**.  
âœ” The **ROC curve indicates strong model performance**, meaning we can use these models for real-world churn prediction.

## **5. Recommendations & Business Actions**  

### **5.1 Strengthen Early Retention Strategies**  
âœ” Offer **new customer onboarding incentives** to encourage long-term contracts.  
âœ” Improve **customer engagement in the first three months** to reduce early churn.  

### **5.2 Encourage Long-Term Contracts**
